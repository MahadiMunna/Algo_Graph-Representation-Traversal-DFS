Graph is a non linear data structure. There will be some nodes and edges.

So graph is the collection of nodes and edges.

Graph roadmap:
1. Terminology
2. Representation
3. Traversal
4. Graph Algorithms

Terminologies:
    node - node is like subject or station
    edge - connection path bewtween nodes 

    depends on direction graph are two types
    1. Directed graph
    2. undirected graph
    depends on edge(weight)
    1. Unweighted
    2. weighted

    Tree - connected graph, no cycle 
    tree detectation formula-> #edges = #vertex -1

Representation:
    there will be given number of nodes, edges and edge connection with nodes with weight or without.

    1. Adjacency Matrix - Matrix representation(1/weight if the there is edge between nodes) - used is dense matrix
    2. Adjacency List - To avoid large Matrix time complexity Adjacency list discovered.(space efficient) - use in sparse matrix
    3. List of edges
 
Traversal:
DFS - Travers nodes in depth order 
BFS - Travers nodes in level order 

Tree Terminologies:
    Child, parent, siblings, root node, leaf node, ancestor(parents to root),
    common ancestor, lowest common ancestor, depth(root to leaf), height(leaf to root)
